## Download
See the file with filename "PixelShot4.exe" in the filelist above? Just download that and double click to launch.

## This program is as simple as it looks like
Just double click the exe under /ScreenShotCapture/bin/debug/PixelShot4.exe, then you are ready to go.

## Setting
Not much to explain here. All keyboard hotkeys are listed in the setting page.

## Mode
This program use two modes. The Active mode and Passive Mode. In simple words, the image is screenshot and cropped when you press the confirm button in Active mode; but in Passive mode, the image is screenshoted at the moment you press screenshot. The screen will appear freezed and you can crop the image using the build in tools.

## Reminder
If you find any bugs in the program, feel free to pull a request, forking your own one or just ask me for the permission to commit to the branch directly. As it has been working perfectly fine on my PC for more than 4 years now (starting from the windows 7), I think this application should be pretty much bugless. Other than some strange Microsoft Win10 updates which might cause some bugs, I don't think this program will have any problem when you are working with it. :))
